### Required Texts

There is no required text book for this class.

All needed material is openly available on the course website. If you
are interested in additional reading on the topics we are covering I
highly recommend [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which is
freely available on the web.

### Course Description

An introduction to data management, manipulation, and analysis, with an
emphasis on environmental and biological problems. Class consists of
short introductions to new concepts followed by hands on computing
exercises using R, but the concepts apply to programming languages and
databases more generally. No background in computing is required.

### Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills

Knowledge of basic environmental science and biology to provide context
for exercises.

### Purpose of Course

In this course you will learn all of the fundamental aspects of computer
programming that are necessary for conducting research in the
environmental and biological sciences. By the end of the course you will
be able to use these tools to import data into R, perform analysis on
that data, and export the results to graphs, text files, and .csv (comma
separated value) files. By learning how to get the computer to do your
work for you, you will be able to do more science faster.

### Course Objectives and Goals

Students completing this course will be able to:

-   Create well structured data
-   Extract information from data
-   Write computer programs in R
-   Automate data analysis
-   Apply these tools to address environmental and biological questions
-   Apply general data management and analysis concepts to other
    programming languages and database management systems

### How this course relates to the Student Learning Outcomes in Environmental Science

This course contributes to the 'Quantitative Skills' Student Learning
Outcomes specified in the [Environmental Science and Technology (BS)
page](https://catalog.coloradomesa.edu/areas-study/environmental-science-technology/environmental-science-technology-bs/),
by providing students the skills and knowledge they need to manage and
analyze the data used in research.

### Teaching Philosophy

This class is taught using a flipped, learner-centered, approach,
because learning to program and work with data requires actively working
on computers. Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but I
think they work particularly well for computer oriented classes. If
you're interested in knowing more take a look at this great [flipped
classroom
info-graphic](https://assignmentbro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/flipped-classroom-infographics-scaled.jpg).

### Instructional Methods

As a flipped classroom, students are provided with either reading or
video material that they are expected to view/read prior to class.
Classes will involve brief refreshers on new concepts followed by
working on exercises in class that cover that concept. While students
are working on exercises the instructor will actively engage with
students to help them understand material they find confusing, explain
misunderstandings and help identify mistakes that are preventing
students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel applications
and alternative approaches to the data analysis challenges students are
attempting to solve. For more challenging topics class may start with
20-30 minute demonstrations on the concepts followed by time to work on
exercises.

## Course Policies

### Attendance Policy

Attendance will not be taken or factor into the grades for this class.
However, experience suggests that students who regularly miss class
often struggle to learn the material.

### Quiz/Exam Policy

There are no quizzes or exams in this course.

### Make-up policy

Life happens and therefore there is an automatic grace period of 48
hours for the submission of late assignments with no need to request an
extension. However, it is highly recommended that you submit assignments
on time when possible because assignments build on one another and it
can be hard to catch up if you fall behind. Reasonable requests for
longer extensions will also be granted. Assignments turned in after the
48 hour grace period without an extension will be be graded with a 50%
penalty.

### Assignment policy

Assignments are due Sunday night by 11:59 pm Mountain Time. This timing
allows you to be finished with one week's material before starting the
next week's material. Assignments should be submitted via the course D2L
webpage.

### Course Technology

Students are required to provide their own laptops and to install free
and open source software on those laptops (see
[Setup](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/computer-setup) for installation
instructions). Support will be provided by the instructor in the
installation of required software. If you don't have access to a laptop
please contact the instructor and they will do their best to provide you
with a departmental machine.

### Materials and Supplies Fees

There are no materials and supplies fees for this course.

## CMU Policies

Students should be aware of all official [CMU
policies](https://d2l.coloradomesa.edu/content/Policies%20and%20Services/CMU%20Policies.html)
as well as the Student Code of Conduct as described in the [The Maverick
Guide](https://www.coloradomesa.edu/student-services/maverick-guide.html)

My policy: If you are in my class I want to help you learn and will
happily work with you to make the learning environment equitable for you
and others.

### Academic Honesty and Integrity

The faculty, administration, and students of Colorado Mesa University
support the principle that all individuals associated with the academic
community have a responsibility for establishing, maintaining, and
fostering an understanding and appreciation for academic integrity.

Academic dishonesty undermines the educational experience, lowers morale
by engendering a skeptical attitude about the quality of education, and
negatively affects the relationship between students and faculty.
Academic dishonesty is the intentional act of fraud in an academic
environment/situation/exercise

Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to:

-   Forgery/fabrication/falsification/plagiarism of academic documents
-   Intentionally impeding or damaging the academic work of others
-   Assisting others in acts of academic dishonesty
-   Cheating in the classroom
-   Unauthorized attendance
-   Multiple submissions of the same material to two or more different
    classes without the permission of all instructors involved
-   Unauthorized collaboration
-   Lying/misrepresentation/omission of information to obtain an unfair
    advantage in an academic environment/situation/exercise
-   Unauthorized use of materials or equipment to complete an academic
    requirement
-   Any academic misconduct may be reported to the Department Head and
    Office of Academic Affairs and may result in a failing grade,
    suspension, or dismissal.

These policies are outlined in [The Maverick
Guide](https://www.coloradomesa.edu/student-services/maverick-guide.html)

### Netiquette and Communication Courtesy

All members of the class are expected to follow rules of common courtesy
in all email messages, threaded discussions and chats.

### Software Use

All faculty, staff and students of the university are required and
expected to obey the laws and legal agreements governing software use.
Failure to do so can lead to monetary damages and/or criminal penalties
for the individual violator. Because such violations are also against
university policies and rules, disciplinary action will be taken as
appropriate.

## Grading Policies

Grading for this course is based on 15 equally weighted homework assignments.

Exercises in assignments will be graded as follows:

-   Produces the correct answer using the requested approach: 100%
-   Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an
    incorrect answer: 90%
-   Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core
    concept: 50%
-   Answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the core concept: 0%

### Grading scale

-   **A 89.5-100**
-   **B 79.5-89.4**
-   **C 69.5-79.4**
-   **D 59.5-69.4**
-   **F \<60**
