***ENVS 396 students will need to set up R and RStudio on their own laptops. If you do not have a laptop, you can use a departmental laptop in class which will have the software installed***

## R

Download and install the [R base system](http://cran.rstudio.com/) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Both are needed. Installing RStudio will not automatically install R.
