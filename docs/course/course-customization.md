title: Customizing the Course for Your Needs
---

This course is based on the [Data Carpentry for Biologists](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/) course. 


All the source files for this iteration of the course can be found at [Justin Pomeranz's GitHub page](https://github.com/Jpomz/ENVS396-FA-2024). 

The website is setup to be easy to run automatically through [GitHub](http://github.com):

- [Fork]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/course/forking-the-course) 
   or import the repository to 
   `https://github.com/yourusername/semester-biology`.
   - You may change the `Repository name` from the 
     `Settings` tab.
   
- Update `# Setup` information in `_config.yml` in the main directory for proper
  site rendering.
  - You must `push` this change to your repository to build and browse your 
    forked version.
  - In a few minutes you should be able to see a copy of the site at:
    `https://yourusername.github.io/ENVS396-FA-2024/`
  - If you want to use a custom domain name instead of `github.io`, follow
    [GitHub's instructions for setting up a custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/).

- [Add or Edit]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/course/manage-files) any of the course content files. In particular, you will be interested to update:
  - course description in `index.md` in the main directory
  - course details and policy in `syllabus.md` in the main directory
  - `assignments:` list in the `schedule.md` front matter
  - motivation and support documents in `about/`
  - software download and install in `computer-setup.md`

- If you have any problems please [let me know via email ({{ site.email }})](mailto:{{ site.email }})  and I'll be happy to help.
